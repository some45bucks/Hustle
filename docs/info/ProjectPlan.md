# Hustle

## Project Overview
This project will provide a system for a community to use to schedule and perform yardwork. This system will allow customers to submit a job they need done from the following types: Lawn Mowing, Leaf Raking, and Snow Shoveling. Employees of this system will be able to accept jobs and recieve an agreed upon wage from the customer for doing said job. Both the customer and the employee will be able to review each other.

## Team Organization

Developers: Jacob Haight, Hagen Larsen, Jade Blunt, Bennett DenBleyker

Scrum Master Milestone 1: Bennett DenBleyker

Scrum Master Milestone 2: Jade Blunt

## Software Development Process
The software development process will be broken up into four phases. Each phase will be a little like a Sprint in an Agile method and a little like an iteration in a Spiral process. Specifically, each phase will be like a Sprint, in that work to be done will be organized into small tasks, placed into a sprint backlog, and prioritized. Then, using on time-box scheduling, the team will decide which tasks the phase (Sprint) will address. The team will use a GitHub Repository to keep track of tasks (issues) in the product backlog. Those tasks that will be part of the current Sprint will be kept in the GitHub Project, those in progress, and those that are done.

Each phase will also be a little like an iteration in a Spiral process, in that each phase will include some risk analysis and that any development activity (requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, etc.) can be done during any phase. Early phases will focus on understanding (requirements capture and analysis) and subsequent phases will focus on design and implementation. Each phase will include a retrospective.

Phases:
1. Requirements Gathering
2. Diagrams and Prototyping
3. Implementation
4. Deployment

## Communication Policies, Procedures, and Tools
Group text message - Main channel for communication. Used for group conversations outside of meetings.

Zoom - Main channel for remote meetings. All groups calls will be done on Zoom.

Github - Formal platform used for communication with Dan Watson and Rob Johnson and submissions. Task progress will also be housed here in the projects section. 

## Risk Analysis
 - UI:
    - Likelihood: Low
    - Severity: High
    - Consequence: Inabilty for customers and users to schedule and accept jobs easily.
    - Word-Around: N/A. The whole system is based upon both types of users being able to easily and quickly interact with the application. There is no value to this project if the users cannot use it.

 - Login:
    - Likelihood: Low
    - Severity: Med
    - Consequence: Inabilty for users to accomplish the tasks for their user type. Customers need to be able to login to post a job and employees need to be able to login to accept posted jobs.
    - Work-Around: N/A. Each login needs to be tied to the user type to allow the user to perform the appropraite tasks.

 - Customer Confidentiality:
    - Likelihood: Low
    - Severity: Med
    - Consequence: Customer information being accessible by users other than the employee who accepts the job is a confidentiality issue for the customer. For example, the contact information for the customer.
    - Work-Around: Only allow exact contact information about a customer to become available to the employee who accepts the job after they accept it. Allow address to be seen before acceptance of the job.

 - Database Structure:
    - Likelihood: Low
    - Severity: High
    - Consequences: Inaccurate database administration would lead to issues with account balances, employee schedules, and user reviews.
    - Work-Around: N/A. The application will not be able to function without an adequate database structure and proper database administration.
